## About This Project

This project is private, and contributions are made within the companyâ€™s internal team. Below are the guidelines for contributing effectively to maintain the codebase and ensure smooth collaboration.

## How This is Build

This code initially generate with this command

```bash
pnpm create expo-app
```

It will use [`default`](https://docs.expo.dev/more/create-expo/#--template) template.

After that, we add tamagui and use expo-font. Follow [full tutorial here](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/expo).

```bash
pnpm install tamagui @tamagui/config
pnpm dlx expo install expo-font
```

To make sure we can use expo go server from WSL, we will use `@expo/ngrok`.

```
pnpm install @expo/ngrok
```

and change `package.json`

```diff
"scripts": {
-  "start": "expo start",
+  "start": "expo start --tunnel",
  "android": "expo run:android",
  "ios": "expo run:ios",
  "web": "expo start --web",
  "test": "jest --watchAll"
}
```

## Working on Issue

1. **Issue Assignment**: Issues are assigned by the lead or yourself. Once an issue is assigned to you, ensure you fully understand the requirements before starting. Hint: ask.

2. **Create a branch from main**: Use the following naming convention for branches:

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

For example:

```
feat/1234-add-user-table
fix/5678-typo-in-profile
fix/5678-grid-in-home-scren
refactor/6021-api-user-payload
```

3. You may create several branches and PRs for a single issue if needed. E.g. When the implementation is bigger than expected in the initial discussion
4. Branch types should follow **conventional commit categories** such as:

   - `feat`: Introduce a new feature
   - `fix`: Fixing a bug
   - `refactor`: Changing the structure of the code **without altering its external behavior** (no breaking changes)
   - `chore`: Routine tasks or maintenance changes that **don't affect the logic or functionality of the application**
   - There are other categories, but we usually use these 4.

5. **Trunk-Based Development**: Our project uses a [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) strategy. Before creating a PR, ensure your branch is always rebased from the latest main. This helps avoid merge conflicts and keeps history clean. **Set Git to Pull with Rebase** before working on a project (only one time).

```
# Setup git pull to use rebase globally
$ git config --global pull.rebase true

# Go to the project folder
$ cd project

# In the main branch, you create a new branch
(main)
$ git pull origin main
(main)
$ git checkout -b feat/1234-add-user-table
Switched to a new branch 'feat/1234-add-user-table'

(feat/1234-add-user-table)
$ git add . && git commit -m "feat: create a migration for user table"

(feat/1234-add-user-table)
$ git pull origin main
$ git push origin feat/1234-add-user-table
```

Ps: More advanced usage is separating `git pull` to `git fetch origin` and `git rebase origin/main`, using `git diff` in between.

6. You may need to solve a conflict after pull from main. By selecting the correct code, you should be fine. Please discuss with your peer that has last commit in main. Tricks to get less conflict:
   - Working on small changes or small number of files. Break the task to smaller action.
   - Make sure you pull before create a new branch
   - Make sure you are not stalling a branch for too long (several days)
   - Sometimes you better to stash your changes before pull, then apply it

## Writting Commit Messages

**Before you commit**:

- Please check what you want to commit.
- Make sure every file that will be committed already saved and in the staging area.
- Make sure there is no hard coded credential in code or in a file that should be ignored.
- Well, you are welcome to commit often actually.

We are following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), please read it. Scope that we use:

- Type: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` and `chore`. To simplify, other type like `ci`, `docs`, `test` will be in the `chore`.
- If there is implementation that not finished yet, please write a `TODO: your msg` in your code and tell it in the body.
- If there is a breaking changes, write it in the body what and why it change

> About Breaking Changes:<br /><br />
> When you write something that make your user to change their behaviour, then it's a Breaking Changes.<br />
> example 1: A backend change the API field from `user` to `customer`, it's a breaking since FE need to change immediately.<br />
> example 2: A backend add a field `customer` that have same content with `user` and mark `user` as deprecated, it's not breaking.<br />

For one liner commit, you can use:

```
git commit -m "feat: create a migration for user table"
```

For commit with description (e.g. a breaking changes), you can run `git commit` and it will open your code editor. If your default is vim and you are not familiar with it:

- Press `i` to enter `insert mode`.
- After you finish writing your message, press `esc` or `ctrl+c` to enter `normal mode`
- In normal mode, press `:wq` to write and quit or `:q!` to exit without saving.

## Code Review

1. **Prepare the PR for Review**

- Rebase from main: Ensure your branch is rebased with the latest main branch to prevent conflicts.
- Verify All Checks Pass: Make sure all tests and automated checks pass before requesting a review.

1. **Notify Reviewers Manually**

Donâ€™t rely solely on GitHub notifications. Mention the peer reviewers in your team chat and share the PR title and URL for direct access.

1. **Collaborative Benefits of Code Review**

Skill Development:

- **Senior-to-Junior**: Senior developers can guide juniors, ensuring code is functional and aligns with standards.
- **Junior-to-Senior**: Junior reviewers can learn best practices and observe how complex features are built.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Peers can engage in discussions that enhance skills and broaden their approach to problem-solving.

1. **PR Size and Readability**

- **Small, Focused PRs**: Aim to submit small, focused PRs for easier review. Large PRs that are difficult to read **should be rejected**, except in special cases.
- **Constructive Feedback Only**: Reviews should be objective, focusing on code improvements, not personal judgments.

1. **Handling Long Discussions**

Move Extended Discussions Elsewhere: If a discussion is likely to be lengthy, consider moving it to another forum (e.g., online meeting) and documenting a summary of the discussion on the PR page to provide context for future reference.

1. **Approvals and Merging**

- Reviewers indicate approval by labeling the PR as approved.
- The author is then responsible for ensuring a final rebase, confirming a squash and merge for clean commit history, and completing the merge (press the merge button and celebrate ðŸŽ‰).
